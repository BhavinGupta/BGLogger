# BGLogger
A Dynamic Swift Logger for debug mode to print the values for your project.

BGLogger is a simple printing logger for your project in debug mode 		    
when set to true value and while production just set the logger to 			    
false so the logger gets disabled in whole project for better build 		    
while showing the demo.
